- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @engelba
- ðŸŽ“ I am a PhD student at the CEA Paris-Saclay. Iâ€™m currently working on generation of 3D representation, such as NeRFs and Gaussian Splatting.
- ðŸŒ± I mostly code in C/C++, JavaScript and Python. I mainly use PyTorch in my work, but I'm always eager to learn new technos.
